<br> I'm a data scientist in the AI team at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com/in/en), where I build time-series models for alarm-detection. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for language and vision tasks.

Previously, I graduated top 5 % from IIT Madras, where I completed by B.Tech in Chemical Engineering and Masters in Data Science.

When I'm not doing ML, I like to play violin, and piano and work out. <br>
